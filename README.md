## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

As my first JS personal project from scratch, this was a great learning experience to solidify my foundations on the holy trinity of web development. The project was built in iterations: first, as a game playable only via prompts and console logs, then the UI design materializing from a paper sketch, and finally integration of the UI with JavaScript (and a ton of refactors) to make the final game.

Key things I learned:

- HTML DOM Methods, Events, and Properties
- CSS Reset
- Flexbox
- CSS Combinators
- CSS Pseudo-classes
- How to create a pop-up modal box

### Continued development

- Implement semantic HTML
- Improve use of units for more responsive design (e.g. rem for font-size)
- Improve mobile layout

### Useful resources

- [How to Create Popup Modal Box in HTML CSS & JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4hkueyp7zY) This video served as my guide in creating the pop-up modal. What I changed is when the modal will be triggered - instead of a button to be clicked, the modal will be shown when the game ends.
